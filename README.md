# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling for database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that fails to properly handle errors during database queries, resulting in a poor user experience.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling. 

## Bug

The original code lacks proper error handling. If the database query fails (e.g., due to a network issue or invalid user ID), a generic 'Error' message is sent to the client. This lacks sufficient information for debugging and provides a poor user experience.  The user receives no indication of the root cause of the failure.

## Solution

The solution implements comprehensive error handling.  It checks for errors from the database and sends informative error responses to the client with appropriate HTTP status codes.  This aids debugging and provides the user with a more meaningful error message.
